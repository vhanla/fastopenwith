# FastOpenWith 

This is a Shell Extension for Windows that allows to customize its shortcut letter for the File Explorer's contextual menu.

Its main purpose is to detect and select a customized list of programs that the user will pick to open any file with, thus, this will speed opening those files in some scenarios.

For instance, you have a C++ source code file you want to open, but you don't like the Visual Studio to launch on double clicking it. You can right click that file and select Fast Open With, and it will list the currently source code editor running and you can open with any of them, as they're already running, opening with them will be faster. ??

As a programmer, I'm more of a keyboard person than a mouse person, so I rather hit the combo `Menu Key ?` + `W` while selecting a file, since W is less used in the File Explore's contextual menu list. So hitting those combo (which of course it will be customizable for any other letter), will execute Fast Open With shell extension, and it will detect the running programs that matches the custom list of executables, and with that opening that file will likely be more comfortable.

If none is running, we can always pick the program we want with.
